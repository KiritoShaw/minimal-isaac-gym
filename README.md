# Minimal Isaac Gym
This repository provides a minimal example of NVIDIA's [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym), to assist other researchers like me to quickly understand the code structure for large-scale reinforcement learning experiments.

The example is based on the official Isaac Gym's [Benchmark Experiments](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs), for which we have followed a similar implementation on [Cartpole](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs/blob/main/isaacgymenvs/tasks/cartpole.py), with minimal number of code aiming for maximal readability, and without using any third-party RL frameworks. 

**Note**: The example is based on Isaac Gym Preview Version 3.

## Usage
Simply run `python trainer.py`.

## Disclaimer
I am also very new to Isaac Gym, and therefore I cannot guarantee my implementation is absolutely correct. If you find anything unusual or unclear that can be improved, PR or issues are highly welcomed.
